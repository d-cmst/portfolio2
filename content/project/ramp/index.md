Ramp is a python library for rapid prototyping of machine learning solutions. It's a light-weight pandas-based machine learning framework pluggable with existing python machine learning and statistics tools (scikit-learn, rpy2, etc.). Ramp provides a simple, declarative syntax for exploring features, algorithms and transformations quickly and efficiently.
